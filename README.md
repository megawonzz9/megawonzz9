# 👋 Hi there! I'm Tymek

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a student and passionate low-level programming enthusiast who loves exploring how things work under the hood — especially with **Rust**.

## 🧠 About Me
- 🎓 I'm currently studying programming in a technical secondary school.
- 🛠 I enjoy building efficient, clean, and safe software using **Rust**, and sometimes diving into **C/C++** or **assembly** when I want to get closer to the metal.
- 🔍 I love experimenting with systems programming, network protocols, file systems, and performance optimization.
- 🧰 Tools I like: `cargo`, `valgrind`, `lldb`, `nvim`, and a clean terminal setup.

## 🚀 Projects & Interests
- 🦀 Rust CLI tools and system utilities
- 🔌 Peer-to-peer programs
- 📦 Minimal Linux utilities and OS-level tools
- 📈 Rust web backend with `axum` or `actix-web`
- 🧪 Low-level algorithms and memory-safe data structures
